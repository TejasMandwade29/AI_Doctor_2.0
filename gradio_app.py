            - Use the symptom selector above
            - Add brief audio description if needed
            - No image required for internal problems
            
            **For Visible Issues:**
            - Take clear, well-lit photos
            - Include something for scale (like a coin)
            - Take multiple angles if possible
            
            **General Tips:**
            - Be specific about symptom duration
            - Mention any existing conditions
            - Describe what makes symptoms better/worse
